With the latest release of [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/overview), and one of its continuing features is [Podman](https://podman.io/). Podman offers an experience similar to the Docker command line, allowing users to run standalone (non-orchestrated) containers without requiring a daemon, enabling us to say goodbye to big fat daemons. Podman also complements similar container tools such as  [Buildah](https://buildah.io/) and [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo), offering a comprehensive and flexible toolkit for your container needs.

Podman implements nearly all the Docker CLI commands. Additionally, Podman's design, which does not require any background daemons, makes it a suitable choice for integration into system services via `systemd`. For container orchestration, you might want to explore [Kubernetes](https://developers.redhat.com/topics/kubernetes) and [Red Hat OpenShift](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/overview).

We'll cover some real examples to show how easy transitioning from the Docker CLI to Podman can be. (See also: [Transitioning from Docker to Podman](developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/19/transitioning-from-docker-to-podman))

## Podman installation

If you are running [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/05/10/how-new-rhel-92-improves-developer-experience?sc_cid=7013a0000034ZDPAA2) or [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](https://developers.redhat.com/rhel8), follow the step below. This command will also work for [CentOS](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/centos-and-rhel), where Podman is available in the default repo for CentOS 7 and 8. If not, you can try our interactive lab on how to [deploy a container using Podman](https://developers.redhat.com/learn/lessons/deploying-containers-podman?intcmp=7013a0000026UTXAA2).

To install the podman package, simply execute the command:

```bash
$ yum install -y podman
```


This command will install Podman and also its dependencies. Now you can start experimenting with Podman!

## Command-line examples

### Run a UBI (Universal Base Image) Container

Let's start by running a [UBI (Universal Base Image)](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/ubi) container. Assuming you are on a RHEL system, execute the below command. After you see the shell prompt, you are inside the running UBI container.

```
$ podman run -it registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi sh
Trying to pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest...
Getting image source signatures
Checking if image destination supports signatures
Copying blob 33b9f09cff46 done  
Copying config e7236a3e07 done  
Writing manifest to image destination
Storing signatures
sh-5.1$
```

Now you have a RHEL container running. You can use the `ls` command to list non-hidden files in the current directory and `exit` to leave the container's shell.

```
sh-5.1$ ls 
afs  boot  etc   lib    lost+found  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
bin  dev   home  lib64  media       opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
sh-5.1$ exit
exit
```

You can now explore various Podman commands to check the status of your containers and delete containers or images as needed.

To view the status of your containers, execute:

```
$ podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                       COMMAND     CREATED         STATUS                    PORTS       NAMES
1d49374d4964  registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest  sh          10 minutes ago  Exited (0) 2 minutes ago              loving\_mendeleev second ago reverent\_torvalds
```

To remove a container, use the `podman rm` command followed by the container ID:

```
$ podman rm 1d49374d4964
1d49374d4964
```

To remove an image, use the `podman image rm` command followed by the image name:

```
$ podman image rm registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest
Untagged: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest
Deleted: e7236a3e070f267713ad79c451b8628166abc0bc9c855f624619e099ec3faa99
```

As you can see, we used the same syntax as we'd use with `docker`.

### Run a MariaDB persistent container

Let's move on to a more complicated example: running a MariaDB 10.5 SQL database server container with custom variables and persistent data.

First, download the MariaDB container image and inspect its details:

```
$ podman pull docker.io/library/mariadb:10.5
Trying to pull docker.io/library/mariadb:10.5...
Getting image source signatures
Copying blob 818ec8e8ed03 done  
...
Copying config 9a79847e85 done  
Writing manifest to image destination
Storing signatures
9a79847e85fb307d90864c991fc925e2d33b3ca6f9d3908008e456725a8f2cf1
```

Now, you can use `podman images` to view the image we've just downloaded.

```
$ podman images
REPOSITORY                 TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
docker.io/library/mariadb  10.5        76a5b2d8081a  3 weeks ago     399 MB
```

This is because container filesystems are ephemeral, meaning once the container is removed, all the data associated with it is lost, we'll create a new volume to hold database data. Then, if we don't already have `mysql` to work with the data in MariaDB, we can also install it using `yum`.

```
$ podman volume create mariadb\_data
mariadb\_data
$ yum install -y mysql
Installed:
  mariadb-connector-c-config-3.2.6-1.el9\_0.noarch                       
  mysql-8.0.32-1.el9\_2.x86\_64                                           
  mysql-common-8.0.32-1.el9\_2.x86\_64                                    
Complete!
```

And finally, let's run this container, running Podman with the following flags: -d for detached mode (in the background), `-e` for setting environment variables, `-p` for port assignment, `-v` to route the volumes, and use the previously downloaded MariaDB image.

```
$ podman run --name mariadb -e MYSQL\_ROOT\_PASSWORD=pass -p 3306:3306 -v mariadb\_data:/var/lib/mysql -d docker.io/library/mariadb:10.5
00388490e13e9cb64b4f79ff4a56d250b725b67190e450251adbe3649cc280c2
```

Now, we can list the current running containers with `podman ps`.

```
$ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                           COMMAND     CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                   NAMES
00388490e13e  docker.io/library/mariadb:10.5  mysqld      25 seconds ago  Up 26 seconds  0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp  mariadb
```

As you can see, the container is up and running, but what is it doing? Let's check using `podman logs`, and doing a `grep` with `head` to see the most recent activity in the logs.

```
$ podman logs 00388490e13e | head
2023-06-08 18:10:09+00:00 \[Note\] \[Entrypoint\]: Entrypoint script for MariaDver 1:10.11.3+maria~ubu2204 started.B Server 1:10.11.3+maria~ubu2204 started.
2023-06-08 18:10:10+00:00 \[Note\] \[Entrypoint\]: Switching to dedicated user 'mysql'
2023-06-08 18:10:10+00:00 \[Note\] \[Entrypoint\]: Entrypoint script for MariaDB Server 1:10.11.3+maria~ubu2204 started.
2023-06-08 18:10:10+00:00 \[Note\] \[Entrypoint\]: Initializing database files
```

Ah! It just started and has initialized its database. Now, to get the IP address of the container and connect to it using TCP, we can use a `podman inspect` command.

```
$ podman inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' mariadb
10.88.0.10
```

Perfect, now we can run the `mysql` client using the server address like so, and using the password `pass` we set when running this MariaDB container.

```
$ mysql -h 10.88.0.10 -u root -p
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \\g.
Your MySQL connection id is 3
Server version: 5.5.5-10.5.20-MariaDB-1:10.5.20+maria~ubu2004 mariadb.org binary distribution
```

Within the MariaDB container, we can run regular commands that we would on any MySQL server.

```
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information\_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance\_schema |
+--------------------+

mysql> CREATE DATABASE test;
Query OK, 1 row affected

mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information\_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance\_schema |
| test               |
+--------------------+
```

Perfect. With everything looking good, we can exit the MariaDB server.

```
mysql> exit;
Bye
```

Once finished with it's usage, we can also kill the container with podman kill, and destroy it as well.

```
$ podman kill mariadb
mariadb
$ podman rm mariadb
mariadb
```

Doing a quick `podman ps`, we can see there are no running containers, but let's start a new container to check for data persistence:

```
$ podman run --name mariadb -e MYSQL\_ROOT\_PASSWORD=pass -p 3306:3306 -v mariadb\_data:/var/lib/mysql -d docker.io/library/mariadb:10.5
```

Now, we can check to see if the container has started again.

```
$ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                           COMMAND     CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                   NAMES
f854d9bdfa38  docker.io/library/mariadb:10.5  mysqld      4 seconds ago  Up 4 seconds  0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp  mariadb
```

Being a new container, we'll again need to get the IP address of the container and connect to it.

```
$ podman inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' mariadb
10.88.0.11
```

Let's go ahead and check the MariaDB server again to ensure our database persisted through the removal of the container earlier, using password `pass`.

```
$ mysql -h 10.88.0.11 -u root -p
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \\g.
Your MySQL connection id is 3
Server version: 5.5.5-10.5.20-MariaDB-1:10.5.20+maria~ubu2004 mariadb.org binary distribution

mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information\_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance\_schema |
| test               |
+--------------------+

mysql> exit;
Bye
```

Great! Looks like our data has persisted, and the new database still is showing through the new container provision. Let's now stop and kill the container to tidy up.

```
$ podman kill f854d9bdfa38
f854d9bdfa38
```

### Manage containers as system services through systemd and Podman

Finally, we'll create a simple `systemd` resource for handling the previously created MariaDB container, which will allow your system to manage your Podman container just like any other system service.

First, we need to create a `systemd` resource file for handling the brand new container service.

```
$ vim /etc/systemd/system/mariadb-container.service
```

Then, we'll paste the following content into the file. This simple service definition will attempt to remove an existing `mariadb` container before starting a new one, and is configured to always restart the service if it stops.

```
[Unit]
Description=MariaDB Podman container
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
TimeoutStartSec=5m
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/podman rm "mariadb"
ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman run --name mariadb -e MYSQL\_ROOT\_PASSWORD=pass -p 3306:3306 -v mariadb\_data:/var/lib/mysql -d docker.io/library/mariadb:10.5
ExecStop=/usr/bin/podman stop "mariadb"
Restart=always
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save and close the file by selecting esc then `:wq`, then we can reload the `systemd` catalog and start the service.

```
$ systemctl daemon-reload
$ systemctl start mariadb-container
```

Let's view the status of the service as well.

```
$ systemctl status mariadb-container
● mariadb-container.service - MariaDB Podman container
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/mariadb-container.service; dis>
     Active: deactivating (stop) since Thu 2023-06-08 19:08:29 UTC; 4s >
    Process: 4910 ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/podman rm mariadb (code=exited,>
    Process: 4919 ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman run --name mariadb -e MYSQL>
   Main PID: 4919 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS); Control PID: 5004 (p>
      Tasks: 8 (limit: 48881)
     Memory: 18.6M
        CPU: 373ms
     CGroup: /system.slice/mariadb-container.service
             ├─5000 /usr/bin/conmon --api-version 1 -c 56cef5dded60b040>
             └─5004 /usr/bin/podman stop mariadb
```

Let's go ahead and stop the service for now, we can also use the command `systemctl enable mariadb-container` to start it automatically at boot.

```
$ systemctl stop mariadb-container
```

Awesome! We just set up a custom system service based on a container managed through Podman.

## Conclusion

In summary, Podman is a powerful container management tool that serves as an alternative to the Docker command-line interface. With its daemonless architecture, it offers a lightweight and efficient solution for running standalone containers. Podman's compatibility with Docker CLI commands and its ability to integrate with system services through systemd make it a versatile choice for container orchestration and management.
